i3-ws-monitor is a bash script that is used for [monitoring usage time](monitoring-usage-time.md) in [i3](http://i3wm.org/).

It is enhanced to support GNOME by running the script with a modified [Argos](https://github.com/skyleecm/argos) GNOME Shell extension. A symlink is created in ~/.config/argos folder to link to i3-ws-monitor

To run in GNOME, it requires GNOME static workspaces, and another utility [xdotool](https://github.com/jordansissel/xdotool/)
